			<h1>HOW TO MAKE TEA</h1>
			<img src="oSVKMED.jpg"alt="Picture of a man drinking tea."width="750"><br>

			<p>At the very least, tea is a flavourful way of getting enough fluid into your body each day. On top of that, studies have shown teas can help protect your teeth and your heart.<br></p>
			<h2>INGREDIENTS</h2><br>
			<ul>
				<li>Tea  bag</li>
				<li>water</li>
				<li>Milk - Dairy/Plant-based (Optional)</li>
				<li>Sugar/honey (Optional)</li>
			</ul><br>
			<h2>PREPARATION</h2><br>
			<ol>
				<li>Run the tap a little so the water's nicely aerated, and only boil it once to keep the oxygen level up. Oxygen in water helps flavour!</li>
				<li>Pop a tea bag into your mug (always a big mug)</li>
				<li>Pour the hot water over the tea bag and stir briefly.</li>
				<li>Tea needs time to unlock all its flavour, so give it 3-4 minutes to do its thing. This is a perfect time to grab a sneaky cookie or daydream about vacations.</li>
				<li>Before removing the tea bag, gently squish it with a spoon against the side of the mug. Not too much or you'll make it bitter.</li>
				<li>If you want, throw in some milk or sugar or honey or nothing else at all.</li>
				<li>Enjoy!</li>
